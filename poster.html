          HOW TO MAKE A MEMORABLE POSTER
        </div>
          <br><br>
        1.  Figure out what you want to say and try to simplify it to as little words as you can. Make sure the words are easy to understand but are easily understandable. If you have lots to say, try thinking about what you are most passionate about and narrow it down to that.

          

          <br><br>
         2. Try sticking to seven words or less.
          <br><br>
         3. Use symbols to make your message even more evident, for example, the peace sign, the equals sign for equality, or a specific sign for your protest.
          <br><br>
        4.  Try to make your poster personal; there might be a common phrase that a lot of people might have on their signs, so try to make yours different and specific to the cause. Some examples would be to relate it to yourself and how this movement will help yourself or include a political statement that describes a film or meme of the time.
        
          <br><br>
         5.  Ask a friend for their feedback on your idea. If they are joining you in the march, see if your poster works well with their signs. 
          <br><br>
         6. Try to make your font bold and easily legible from a distance. You can write your layout in pencil first as well just in case you make any errors. 
          <br><br>
          7.  Use a contrasting colour to your poster colour to make the words or images stand out. 
          <br><br>
         8. Try to make a connection between the text and images, so they support each other and make the message more powerful overall.
          <br><br>
          9.  Limit your colour palette to two or three colours. This keeps it simple, but still compelling. 
          <br><br>
         10.  You can add decorations to attract more viewers to look at your posters like sparkles and stickers.
          <br><br>
          11. Now you are ready to show the world what you stand for!
