          Laws for Protesting in Melbourne
        </div>
          <br><br>
          Depending on the local area, the local council may require you to hold a permit.

            A permit from VicRoads may be required where a protest is likely to impact major roads and freeways.

          <br><br>
          Police are only allowed to request you to vacate a public place or shut down a protest if your behaviour is a threat to public safety, property is being damaged, or protestors are engaging in violence. If you are asked to leave a public area, you are generally not allowed to return to that location for 24 hours.
          <br><br>
         You may be confronted or questioned by police during a protest. It is best to stay calm during this process, and knowing your rights can help you do this.
          <br><br><br><br>
        <div class="bold">
          Remember these key rights:
        </div>
          <br><br>
          Generally, a police officer can only ask you to give your name and address if they believe you: have committed an offence or are about to commit an offence. However, it is an offence to refuse to give police your name and address or to give police a false name and address if they have a lawful reason to ask you for your details.
          <br><br>
          You are not required to provide any information beyond your name and address if questioned by police. In these cases, you are able to exercise your right to be silent to any other questions and state ‘no comment’. 
          <br><br>
          There is no such thing as speaking ‘off the record’. Anything you say to a police officer may be used by them to arrest or charge you. The police could use the things you said as evidence in court to show that you broke the law.
          <br><br>
          If you are put under arrest, you must be told that you are being arrested and why.
          <br><br>
          A police officer can also direct a person who is wearing a face covering to leave a designated area. The police officer must reasonably believe that the person is wearing the face covering primarily to conceal their identity or to protect themselves from the effects of crowd-controlling substances (e.g. capsicum spray).
